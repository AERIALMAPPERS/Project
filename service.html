                A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps
                all types of data. GIS connects data to a map,

                        These needs are conventionally met by either satellite imagery which is very inaccurate and
                        obsolete.Also via conventional
                        surveys using ground equipment which takes days to deliver the final outputs. Our drones can
                        produce sophisticated 2D maps.
                        That enable you to fill in imaging gaps left by satellite mapping with up-to-date data. We
                        currently provide services to
                        construction,the oil & gas industry, landscape architects, surveyors to name a few.

                        Using our drones, we offer high-resolution maps for the purpose at the most affordable cost.
                        Dronitech AerialIntelligence platform
                        provides a set of tools for visualizing, measuring and storing data. Intuitive commands
                        allow the user to visualize a site in 2D or
                        3D.Which includes support for orthophotography, digital surface and 3D models.

                        Our team is specialized in large area mapping.Also has completed several big projects for
                        varied applications.</p>

                        <br>
                    <p>A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps
                        all types of data. GIS connects data to a map,
                        integrating location data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what
                        things are like there).
                        This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science and almost every
                        industry.
                        GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships, and geographic context.
                        The benefits include improved communication and efficiency as well as better management and
                        decision making.</P>

                    <p> 3-D Mapping, aka “Photogrammetry 3D Models” are used in fields such as topographic mapping,
                        architecture, engineering, manufacturing,
                        quality control, police investigation, cultural heritage, and geology.
                        Archaeologists use it to quickly produce plans of large or complex sites, and meteorologists
                        use it to determine the wind speed of tornadoes
                        when objective weather data cannot be obtained.</p>

                        <br>
                    <p>DTM (Digital Terrain Model) typically augments a DEM, by including vector features of the
                        natural terrain, such as rivers and ridges.
                        A DTM may be interpolated to generate a DEM,DTM’s terrain-focused precision each play a
                        unique role in shaping our spatial insights.
                        DTM is a vector data set consisting of dots at regular intervals and natural features such
                        as
                        mountain ridge and breaking lines (a line in the model showing a marked cut in the slope of
                        a surface, such as a road or a stream).
                        DSM (Digital Surface Model) captures both the natural and built/artificial features of the
                        environment,
                        A DSM is useful in 3D modeling for telecommunications, urban planning, and aviation. Because
